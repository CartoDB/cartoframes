    "# CARTO Data Observatory - Data Enrichment\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook shows how to use CARTOframes to enrich a dataframe with data from CARTO's Data Observatory. Please, visit [CARTOframes Guides](https://carto.com/developers/cartoframes/guides/) to learn more about the enrichment functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will show CARTOframes enrichment functionality with an example in which we will quantify the number of eating places within a 5-minute isochrone for all sports POI's in Madrid downtown.\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook is organized as follows:\n",
    "1. [Download sports POIs](#section1)\n",
    "2. [Calculate isochrones](#section2)\n",
    "3. [Enrich isochrones](#section3)\n",
    " - [Simple enrichment: Counting the number of POI's within isochrones](#section31)\n",
    " - [Enrichment applying filters: Counting the number of eating places](#section32)\n",
    " - [Brief analysis](#section33)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note** for this notebook we are using the premium [dataset of Pitney Bowes POI's in Spain](https://carto.com/spatial-data-catalog/browser/dataset/pb_points_of_i_94bda91b/)."
