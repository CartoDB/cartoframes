## Introduction

Use these guides to learn about integrating CARTOframes into your **data science** workflows. Working inside of a Jupyter notebook, the guides walk through initial set-up and installation, reading data from CARTO into your Python session, writing data to your CARTO account, discovering data in our catalog, enriching data, using geocoding and isolines data services, and the basics of visualizing your data on a map.
